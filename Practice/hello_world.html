Hello World!
<p> There once was a girl who knew too much.
It was very confusing to learn all of this...coding. </p>
  <!This is a comment about how hard this is you can't see me!>
  <!You shouldn't use heading tags to make bold fonts>
  <//this should also be a comment tag for the developer?>
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>Going All the Way</head>
  <body style= "background-color:#F2D7D5;">?

    <h1> <center>This is a heading tag </center></h1>
      <font size='5'; color="red"> This is some text! </font>
<hr> <! hr stands for those line breaks on the page>
    <h2 style="font-family:algerian;">The font size shouold get smaller?</h2>
    <!so yes, this is messy and using CSS i should split them into smaller lines>
    <font size = '10'; color="green"> This should be green and under h2. </font>
    <p> does this go inbetween h2 and h3?</p>
      <p> what happens when I indent? Should not effect the look of the page.</p>
      <center><p> I was right so how do i make it go center of the webpage?<p></center>

    <h3> Can I Change the Font Type?
      <p style="font-family:courier;"> I can change the size of the font but how about the type?</p>
    <p> this is a paragraph tag...who knew?</p>
<hr>
    <h4> <center> I'm going to code an equation.</center></h4>
      <center><button>I lied.

      <div>
      </button></center>
      <center><button> THIS! </button></center>
      <!this button doesn't do anything, have to figure out how to make it work>
      <!apparentely you have to use CSS to style HTML>

<!this next part should follow the format I code it in. Spaces and random things in all>

          “For instance,
           on the planet Earth,
           man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—
           the wheel,
            New York,
             wars and so on—
             whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.
